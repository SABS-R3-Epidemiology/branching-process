This is a term project in which we are using branching processes to model the time-dependent reproduction number (the number of cases each infected individual will subsequently cause) of an infectious disease.

All features of our software are described in detail in our
[full API documentation](https://branchpro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

More details on branching process models and inference can be found in these
papers:
