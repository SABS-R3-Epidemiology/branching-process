##### BranchPro: inference of $R\_t$

In order to make predictions about how case numbers will evolve in the future, we require an estimate of the reproduction number $R\_t$. One common method of estimating $R\_t$ is to infer (using Bayesian inference) from recent incidence data. Below, we do just that: given the incidence data for 30 days, we can infer the value of $R\_t$ over that time period.
