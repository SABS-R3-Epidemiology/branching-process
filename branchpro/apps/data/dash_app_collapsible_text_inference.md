##### How do we estimate R_t?

With our branching process model one can predict future case numbers based on three pieces of information: the initial number of cases $I_0$, the reproduction number over time $\{R_0, R_1, R_2, ... \}$, and the serial interval distribution $\{w_0, w_1, w_2, ... \}$. These are the parameters of the model, that is the numbers that serve as the model's inputs, as opposed to the model's output, namely the predicted case numbers $\{I_1, I_2, I_3, ... \}$. If we know the parameter values, then the model can predict the future case numbers. For example, virologists might have very precise estimates of the serial interval, public health data might give a good estimate of $I_0$, and epidemiologist might be able to provide reasonable estimates for the reproduction number over time. Predicting future case numbers when the model parameters are known is known as a forward problem. We have already described how the Branchpro model solves the forward model.

Suppose now that we know the values of $I_0$ and the serial interval distribution $\{w_0, w_1, w_2, ... \}$ but that we do not know what the reproduction number is. This is a problem if we are hoping to predict future case numbers (i.e. the forward problem). In this scenario, our first task is to come up with an estimate of the current reproduction number. One of the most common ways of doing this is to infer it from past case numbers. For example, given the case numbers for the last 10 days, we can infer the value of the reproduction number at present by assuming that those case numbers were simulated by the Branchpro model. This is called an inverse problem: the goal is to use case numbers to infer the value of a parameter, the opposite of the forward problem. Our web app can solve this inverse problem.
