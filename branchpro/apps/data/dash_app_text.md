##### BranchPro

BranchPro is an open source software package for the simulation of infectious disease case numbers and inference of the effective reproduction number from case data. This web application demonstrates some of its capabilities.

BranchPro can simulate daily incidence numbers (new cases) by using a branching process model. The only inputs needed from the user are the initial numebr of cases $I_0$ and the value of the disease's reproduction number $R_t$. This app also allows the user to change the reproduction number at a user-specified time.
