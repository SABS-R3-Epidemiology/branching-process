##### BranchPro

BranchPro is an open source software package for the simulation of infectious disease case numbers and inference of the effective reproduction number from case data. This web application demonstrates some of its capabilities.

BranchPro can simulate daily incidence numbers (new cases) by using a branching process model. The only inputs required from the user are the initial number of cases $I\_0$ and the value of the disease's reproduction number $R\_t$. This app also allows the user to change the reproduction number at a user-specified time (to model a public health intervention, for example) and to visualise the resulting change in incidence predictions.
